TODOS:


-The face clip from the image needs to be rotated appropriately. See /photos/Pictures_In_Progress/2019/Baltimore Trip/DSC_1209.JPG
-- Sub: The bounding rectangle must be adjusted appropriately. 
-Extract existing tags (non-face) from image and add them in filepopulator
-Method for adding a tag to an image via API
-Delete methods for face and person that delete it off the media files as well.
-Automate a highlight image when first person is first detected
-Downsize the face thumbnail resolution
-Test that when picture deleted, so are faces (cascading?)

## -A locking mechanism for adding faces (same as with filepopulator -- only one thread running)
## -A cleanup script for faces/people when I want to reset that -- done. python manage.py clearfaces
